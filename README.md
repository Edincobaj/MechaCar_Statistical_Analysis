- Vehicle weight and ground clearance provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
- The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero, this is because we have several coefficients that are below the significance level.
- This linear model can predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes to some degree of certainty because our high R-Squared value at 0.7149.
